    <h5>Why mental peace is important ?</h5>
    <!-- Iteration 6.1: Use a Empty tag for the image present in the directory (assets/download.png) -->

  </center>
  <!-- Iteration 7.1: Put the appropriate opening tag which is going to be a block element -->

  The concept of 'peace' is defined and understood in various ways.
  Understanding peace as absence of violence is a limited vision.
  Peace encompasses happiness and harmony among living beings.
  In a wider understanding, peace is the nature and goal of every sentient being.
  <!-- Iteration 8: Give appropriate tag individually to "money you make" to show them in the inline element -->
  No matter how much money you make, a bigger house, a nicer car,
  or more expensive clothing won't give you peace of mind.
  Expecting material possessions to satisfy your needs will leave you
  sorely disappointed. Mentally strong people aren't necessarily minimalists,
  however. They can enjoy nice things. But they don't expect their material possessions
  to give them joy and contentment.

  <h2>Short-term politics</h2>
  <p>
    "Many of today's world leaders have great courage: the courage to do harm.
    They are ill-advised, too clever, or too skillful. I think bad political systems,
    by which I mean systems that are not founded on a desire for justice, are mainly due to a
    type of short-sightedness. When politicians see things only in the
    short-term they inevitably only see the short-term gains.
    That is how they develop the type of courage that is necessary to harm others."

  <h2>A global family</h2>
  <p>
    "The world is becoming smaller and smaller.
    <!-- Iteration 12: Give as many whitespaces in between any words it will be considered as single space only -->
    Nations are far more interdependent than before.
    Our generation has reached the threshold of a new era of human history: the birth of a
    global family. Whether we like it or not, all the members of our vast and
    varied human family have to learn to live together somehow.
    We need to develop a greater sense of universal responsibility,
    on both the individual and collective level."

  <h2>Our happiness comes from others</h2>
  <p>"In this world, all qualities spring from preferring the wellbeing of others to our own,
    whereas frustrations, confusion, and pain result from selfish attitudes.
    <!-- Iteration 13: Give suitable tag to mark "altruistic" as a hyperlink and give quotes for href attribute and title and also try without quotes to see the error -->
    By adopting an altruistic outlook and by treating others in the way they deserve,
    our own happiness is assured as a byproduct. We should realize that self-centeredness
    is the source of all suffering, and that thinking of others is the source of all happiness."
